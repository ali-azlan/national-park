            Plains are among the highest plateaus in the world. The Deosai Plains cover an area of almost 3,000 square
            kilometers. For just over half the year – between November and May – Deosai is snow-bound. In the summer
            months when the snow clears up, Deosai National Park is accessible from Skardu in the north and the Astore
            Valley in the west.</p>

        <p class="info">Deosai Plains make up one of the last frontiers of natural habitat for the Himalayan brown bear, a creature
            that once roamed the mountains freely. The park currently has inbetween 20-28 Brown bears. This park was
            establised to protect these endangered bears. Recently a research project has started by Himalayan Wildlife
            Foundation (HWF) and the Northern Areas Forests, Parks, and Wildlife Department to secure the survival of
            the brown bear in the Deosai Plains and to monitor their population. The Deosai Plains are also home to the
            ibex, red fox, golden marmot, wolf, the Ladakh urial, the snow leopard, and a number of resident and
            migratory birds.</p>

            <h3>Brown bear</h3> <br>
            <p>The brown bear (Ursus arctos) is a large bear species found across Eurasia and North America. It is one of the largest living terrestrial members of the order Carnivora, rivaled in size only by its closest relative, the polar bear, which is much less variable in size and slightly bigger on average. Adults of different subspecies range in weight from 80 to 600 kg (180 to 1,320 lb), with males being heavier than females.<br>
