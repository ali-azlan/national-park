            is a narrow valley, its gorge running for some 18km before broadening out into a basin surrounded by high
            peaks. Numerous tributaries drain into the Chitral Gol, which flows southwards into the Kunar River.
            Visitors and Visitor Facilities Include two hunting lodges, originally built by the Mehtars.

        <p class="info">ThThis park is famous for its Markhor goats, estimated 100-125 in 1970, and 225 in 1975. A more recent
            estimate indicates a population size of 650. Other ungulates, such as Siberian ibex and Ladakh urial
            (Shapu), occur in very small numbers, as do black bear. The status of snow leopard changed from tenuous
            security in 1970 to seriously threatened by 1974. The species does not appear to be resident, visiting the
            park occasionally. Wolves are seen less frequently following restrictions on grazing by livestock.</p>
