        <p style="color: azure;font-size: 20px; margin-top: 44px; margin-bottom: -70px"">Ayubia National Park is a small national park in the Murree hills. The initial area of
            the park was 1684 ha, expanded through a northern extension in 1998 to make a total of 3312 ha. The park
            supports one of the best remaining examples of moist Himalayan temperate forest in Pakistan and is
            surrounded by seven major villages and three small towns (Nathiagali, Ayubia and Khanspur). The national
            park consists entirely of reserve forests, which spill out of the park area on the west and south sides. The
            scenery is superb with huge pine forests covering the hills and providing shelter to the larger and smaller
            mammals. Ayubia National Park is a major recreation area visited by large numbers of local tourists, mostly
            from Islamabad and Abottabad. No official figures are available, but local estimates suggest that there are
            about 100,000 visitors per year.

        <p class="info">This park provides refuge to the elusive leopard and the black bear. Bird watching is excellent here. Some of
            the bird species pass through the park on migration. The population of the Koklass Pheasant and the rare
            Kalij Pheasant are the highest known for Pakistan. Only 30 individuals of the Kalij Pheasant are known to
            exist in the park.</p>

            <h3>Asiatic leopard</h3> <br>
            <p>Asian leopards have short legs and stocky bodies which gives them a low centre of gravity and allows them to slink through grasslands relatively unseen. Leopard tails are usually longer than half their body length offering a great sense of balance when climbing and eating in trees. Male Asiatic leopards are said to be approximately 30% larger than their female counterparts and live apart as solitary creatures.<br>

            <p style="font-size: 14px;">The American black bear, also known as the black bear, is a species of medium-sized bear endemic to North America. It is the continent's smallest and most widely distributed bear species. The American black bear is an omnivore, with a diet varying greatly depending on season and location. It typically lives in largely forested areas but will leave forests in search of food and is sometimes attracted to human communities due to the immediate availability of food.
