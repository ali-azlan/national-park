            <p style="color: #fff;">Deosai National Park is a high-altitude plateau located in the northern region of
                Pakistan, specifically in the Skardu District of Gilgit-Baltistan. Spanning over 3,000 square
                kilometers, it is one of the largest national parks in the country and is often referred to as the "Land
                of Giants" due to its vast, open landscapes and the presence of the Himalayan brown bear, also known as
                the Deosai bear.
                The park is characterized by its rolling hills, alpine meadows, and snow-capped peaks, making it a haven
                for wildlife and a popular destination for nature enthusiasts.

                <br>
                Deosai National Park is also of great cultural significance, as it is home to several indigenous
                communities, including the Balti people, who have lived in the area for centuries and continue to
                practice their traditional way of life. The park also contains several archaeological sites, including
                ancient ruins and petroglyphs, which provide insight into the region's rich history.
